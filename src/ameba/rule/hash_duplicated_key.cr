module Ameba::Rule
  # A rule that disallows duplicated keys in hash literals.
  #
  # This is considered invalid:
  #
  # ```
  # h = {"foo" => 1, "bar" => 2, "foo" => 3}
  # ```
  #
  # And it has to written as this instead:
  #
  # ```
  # h = {"foo" => 1, "bar" => 2}
  # ```
  #
  # YAML configuration example:
  #
  # ```
  # HashDuplicatedKey:
  #   Enabled: true
  # ```
