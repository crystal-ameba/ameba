module Ameba::Rule::Style
  # A rule that disallows negated conditions in unless.
  #
  # For example, this is considered invalid:
  #
  # ```
  # unless !s.empty?
  #   :ok
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # And should be rewritten to the following:
  #
  # ```
  # if s.emtpy?
  #   :ok
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # It is pretty difficult to wrap your head around a block of code
  # that is executed if a negated condition is NOT met.
  #
  # YAML configuration example:
  #
  # ```
  # NegatedConditionsInUnless:
  #   Enabled: true
  # ```
  #
