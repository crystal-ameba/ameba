module Ameba::Rule::Lint
  # A rule that prohibits the common misconception about how trailing rescue statements work,
  # preventing Paths (exception class names or otherwise) from being
  # used as the trailing value. The value after the trailing rescue statement is the
  # value to use if an exception occurs, not the exception for the rescue to capture.
  #
  # For example, this is considered invalid - if an exception occurs in `method.call`,
  # `value` will be assigned the value of `MyException`:
  #
  # ```
  # value = method.call("param") rescue MyException
  # ```
  #
  # And should instead be written as this in order to capture only `MyException` exceptions:
  #
  # ```
  # value = begin
  #   method.call("param")
  # rescue MyException
  #   "default value"
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Or to rescue all exceptions (instead of just `MyException`):
  #
  # ```
  # value = method.call("param") rescue "default value"
  # ```
  #
  # YAML configuration example:
  #
  # ```
  # Lint/TrailingRescueException:
  #   Enabled: true
  # ```
