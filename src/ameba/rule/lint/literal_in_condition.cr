module Ameba::Rule::Lint
  # A rule that disallows useless conditional statements that contain a literal
  # in place of a variable or predicate function.
  #
  # This is because a conditional construct with a literal predicate will
  # always result in the same behavior at run time, meaning it can be
  # replaced with either the body of the construct, or deleted entirely.
  #
  # This is considered invalid:
  #
  # ```
  # if "something"
  #   :ok
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # YAML configuration example:
  #
  # ```
  # Lint/LiteralInCondition:
  #   Enabled: true
  # ```
