    # Creates a new source by `code` and `path`.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    # ```
    # path = "./src/source.cr"
    # Ameba::Source.new File.read(path), path
    # ```
    #
    def initialize(@code : String, @path = "")

    # Returns lines of code splitted by new line character.
    # Since `code` is immutable and can't be changed, this
    # method caches lines in an instance variable, so calling
    # it second time will not perform a split, but will return
    # lines instantly.
    #
    # ```
    # source = Ameba::Source.new "a = 1\nb = 2", path
    # source.lines # => ["a = 1", "b = 2"]
    # ```
    #
