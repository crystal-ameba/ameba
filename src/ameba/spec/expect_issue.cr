# This mixin makes it easier to specify strict issue expectations
# in a declarative and visual fashion. Just type out the code that
# should generate an issue, annotate code by writing '^'s
# underneath each character that should be highlighted, and follow
# the carets with a string (separated by a space) that is the
# message of the issue. You can include multiple issues in
# one code snippet.
#
# Usage:
#
#     expect_issue subject, %(
#       def foo
#         a do
#           b
#         end.c
#       # ^^^^^ error: Avoid chaining a method call on a do...end block.
#       end
#     )
#
# Equivalent assertion without `expect_issue`:
#
#     source = Source.new %(
#       def foo
#         a do
#           b
#         end.c
#       end
#     ), "source.cr"
#     subject.catch(source).should_not be_valid
#     source.issues.size.should be(1)
#
#     issue = source.issues.first
#     issue.location.to_s.should eq "source.cr:4:3"
#     issue.end_location.to_s.should eq "source.cr:4:7"
#     issue.message.should eq(
#       "Avoid chaining a method call on a do...end block."
#     )
#
# If you do not want to specify an issue then use the
# companion method `expect_no_issues`. This method is a much
# simpler assertion since it just inspects the code and checks
# that there were no issues. The `expect_issue` method has
# to do more work by parsing out lines that contain carets.
